## Storyline and Game Structure:
### Summary
Grove is a 16-bit, top-down, open world, horror adventure game where you awaken as a spirit, just dropped into the afterlife. You have no knowledge of who or what you were in your past. To discover yourself, and why/how you died, you must collect artifacts from the four cardinal directions and bring them to a central location to be assembled by the enigmatic and mysterious antique shop owner who is your guide in this shaded and unsettling world. 
### Characters
* Shade: Player. Unknown identity/past. Revealed through gameplay that they were a witch whose parents were killed for being witches. Their parents were good people who helped the villagers and were murdered unjustly. They are “adopted” by a prominent family in the village who treated them cruelly and eventually killed them in a ritual that splintered their soul to the four cardinal directions. 
* Antique Shop Owner: (Name TBD) Knows who the Shade was and what happened to them.  Guides player through game. Acts as inventory cache, game guide, and memory refresher. Enigmatic, and not always as helpful as they could be depending on level of difficulty. 
* Villagers/NPCs: Revealed through acquired artifacts/memories throughout game.
* Ghost Cat: Companion through game, assists Shade with various tasks. 
*Notes:* The artifacts reveal pieces of Shade’s past, the antique shop is safe spot in what is left of Shade’s mind.
1.	Act One: Gray Afterlife/Antique Shop

Everything around you is gray. You blink your eyes a few times, but nothing changes. There is no sound, no light. Just looming gray structures. There are also, things, darker gray shadows moving around you, but they just go past. You even reach out to touch one, but it goes right through your arm. You wander the gray streets, when finally, you see a faint light. You follow it. The light is emanating from a small shop hunched in an alley. A small sign creaks above the door, barely holding on to the metal post it is secured to. Its faded letters proclaim it "Night Traders". You walk up to the window. The light that emanates from the interior is warm. That glow saturates everything inside and gives everything a cared for appearance. The door seems to open of its own accord and beacons you inside. The ceiling is low, but the length of the store belies how tiny it looks on the outside. The walls are packed with things, all manner of things. Furniture, from all ages that no one could ever picture in their home until it is placed there. Art, glassware, knick-knacks, all the usual things you expect from an antique shop. But these things all have stories, some more fantastical than others. And, if you find the right thing, the thing meant for you, the shop keeper, as hunched and small as the outside of the shop, will tell you that story. When the shop keeper sees the shade, they shake their head and tell the shade they shouldn’t be there. Their story is no longer in the shop but scattered to the four corners of the world. Shade must go to each cardinal direction and retrieve the artifacts that will reveal who they were and what happened to them. Here is where the player is introduced to basic game mechanics and the ghost cat companion whose abilities level up with Shade’s
